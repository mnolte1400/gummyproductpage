Maca Root Powder
Native to the high Andes of Peru, maca has been used for centuries to promote stamina, fertility, and hormone balance. This powerful root may help naturally support testosterone levels and enhance libido and mood.

Maca is also rich in plant compounds that support energy, endurance, and overall vitality.
Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)
Traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine, Horny Goat Weed is native to mountainous regions of East Asia. It's known for supporting male sexual performance and libido.

Its active compound, icariin, helps promote blood flow and hormonal balance, making it a popular choice for men’s wellness.


Damiana
Grown in Mexico and Central America, Damiana has long been used as a natural aphrodisiac and mood enhancer. Ancient cultures prized it for boosting sexual desire and calming anxiety.

Damiana may also support hormone health and contribute to a more relaxed, confident state of mind.
Cordyceps
This rare mushroom is traditionally found in the Himalayas and has been used in Chinese medicine for vitality and longevity. Cordyceps may help enhance energy, endurance, and testosterone production.

It is also known to support workout recovery and natural growth hormone release.


Maitake Mushroom
Revered in Japanese and Chinese healing traditions, Maitake supports immune function, hormone balance, and energy metabolism.

Its adaptogenic properties help the body handle stress, which plays a key role in maintaining healthy testosterone levels.
Ginseng Root
Found in Asia and North America, ginseng is a legendary herb used for boosting energy, stamina, and sexual performance. It supports healthy testosterone levels by improving overall vitality and stress resilience.

Ginseng also promotes focus, endurance, and a balanced mood.


Zinc
Zinc is an essential mineral sourced from the earth’s crust and found in foods like oysters and seeds. It plays a critical role in testosterone production and male reproductive health.
 
Low zinc levels are directly linked to reduced testosterone, making it a key nutrient for hormonal support.
Calcium
Known for its role in bone health, calcium also supports muscle function and nerve signaling—two vital elements in physical performance and recovery.

A proper calcium balance may also help regulate hormone release in the body.


Fenugreek
A staple in Indian and Middle Eastern herbal medicine, Fenugreek supports testosterone levels and male sexual health.

Its rich concentration of saponins is believed to stimulate hormone production and promote fat loss and muscle growth.
Magnesium
Sourced from mineral-rich soils and oceans, magnesium is essential for over 300 enzymatic processes in the body.

It supports testosterone by lowering stress hormones and improving sleep—both critical to natural hormone production.


Boron
Found naturally in fruits, nuts, and soil, boron helps the body metabolize testosterone and vitamin D more effectively.

It plays a subtle but powerful role in increasing free testosterone and improving bone density and cognition.
Tribulus Terrestris
Used in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine, this spiny plant grows in tropical regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Tribulus is best known for enhancing libido, increasing stamina, and helping support natural testosterone levels.
